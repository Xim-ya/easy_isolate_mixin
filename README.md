# Installing

To use the Easy Isolate Mixin package in your Flutter project, follow these steps:

1. Depend on it

Add the following line to your project's `pubspec.yaml` file under the `dependencies` section:

```yaml
dependencies:
  easy_isolate_mixin: ^1.0.0
```

2. Install it

Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```
$ flutter pub get
```

3. Import it

Add the following import statement to your Dart code:

```dart
import 'package:easy_isolate_mixin/easy_isolate_mixin.dart';
```

# Usage

1. Import the package:

```dart
import 'package:easy_isolate_mixin/easy_isolate_mixin.dart';
```


2. Create a class and mixin the `IsolateHelperMixin`:

```dart
class Service with IsolateHelperMixin {
  // Your methods and logic here
}
```

3. Use the `loadWithIsolate()` method to perform expensive work:

```dart
class Service with IsolateHelperMixin {
  Future<void> performExpensiveWork() async {
    final result = await loadWithIsolate(() async{
      // Perform your expensive work here
      // Return the result
    });
    
  }
}
```

In the `performExpensiveWork()` method, you can use the `loadWithIsolate()` method from the `IsolateHelperMixin` to perform your expensive work in a separate isolate. Simply pass a function to `loadWithIsolate()` that contains your expensive computation. The result of the computation will be returned as a `Future`.

## Handling Big Data
Here's an example of using `loadWithIsolate()` to fetch a list of `SomeData` objects:

```dart
class DataSource with IsolateHelperMixin {
  Future<List<SomeData>> fetchAmountOfData() => 
  loadWithIsolate(() => _api.getAmountOfData());
}
```
    
The `_api.getAmountOfData()` function represents your data fetching logic. It will be executed in a separate isolate, allowing your UI to remain responsive while the data is being fetched. The result will be returned as a `Future<List<SomeData>>`.

Note: Make sure the function you pass to `loadWithIsolate()` returns a value or a `Future` that resolves to the desired result type.

That's it! You can now leverage the power of isolates to perform concurrent and computationally intensive tasks without blocking the main thread.
